# 🚢 Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

A beginner-friendly data analysis project that explores the legendary **Titanic dataset** using Python and popular libraries like **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**.

This project was created as part of **Task 2** in my internship program. It focuses on extracting insights from the Titanic dataset through data cleaning, summary statistics, and compelling visualizations.

## 🔍 Exploratory Analysis Highlights

- **Data Overview & Cleaning**:

  - Handled missing values in `Age` and `Cabin`
  - Converted data types and created new features (e.g., `FamilySize`)
- **Survival Insights**:

  - Survival rate by **gender**, **passenger class**, **embarkation point**
  - Age distribution of survivors and non-survivors
- **Visualizations**:

  - Bar plots of survival by class and gender
  - Count plots of embarkation points
  - Heatmap of feature correlations
  - Histograms of age distributions
